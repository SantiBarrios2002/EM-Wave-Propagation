# EM-Wave-Propagation
A real-time electromagnetic wave propagation simulator built in C++ with OpenGL, following the same architecture as kavan010/black_hole. The project visualizes Maxwell's equations in action — showing E and B field vectors, polarization states, wave interference, diffraction, reflection, and refraction
